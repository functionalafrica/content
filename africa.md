## How can you help?

Our short-term goals are focused on **education**. If you have experience teaching a functional programming
language like Haskell or Scala, or any related technologies, and have time to share your skills, then please
join us as a volunteer teacher.
Our teaching program is flexible, and can be expanded to include your regular lessons, or just a one-off
session.

Teaching to a large group is only one part of the solution, and we would like to organize mentorship sessions in
smaller groups. If this interests you, then let us know; we anticipate this beginning in the first quarter of
2021, after our teaching program starts.

We will also begin our Hiring Consultation, and this is where everyone in the technology industry can help. We
would like to conduct some short interviews online, lasting 20-30 minutes with people who have experience of
hiring individuals living in Africa as an employer elsewhere in the world.

That includes both positive and negative experiences. It's valuable information for us to know what worked as
well as what didn't work.

We plan to report on the findings of our consultation in the third quarter of 2021, which will motivate our
next steps: the geographical and technological areas we focus on, the programs of work we embark upon, and the
budget we seek to support them. Only then will we ask you for donations.

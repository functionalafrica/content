## What is Functional Africa?

**We believe that software developers should be able to receive the best education and participate in the global
marketplace on the merit of their abilities, wherever in the world they are.**

**Functional Africa** is a program to provide education in **functional programming** to aspiring developers in
Africa who don't have access to the same teaching that the long-established tech communities in Europe and
America enjoy.

We want to make it easier for developers in Africa to participate in a global economy that is increasingly open
to remote work, without artificial barriers. We want it to be easier for anyone to apply for a remote job in
Haskell or Scala, and easier for employers to hire them.

**The Internet is open. Africa is coming online. And the world is waking up to remote work.**

**Functional Africa** is just beginning on its journey towards charitable status. Starting in 2021, we will begin
a program of free, interactive, online teaching in Scala, alongside a six-month consultation to investigate the
what impediments are holding back Africa's involvement in the world of functional programming.

Of all of Africa's diverse exports — coffee and cotton, copper or coal — one that should be easier to trade
with the rest of the world, with a lower environmental impact, is **code**.

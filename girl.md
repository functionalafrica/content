## Why Africa?

Africa is a diverse continent of 54 nations and 1.3 billion people — coincidentally the same as the combined
totals for North America and Europe. But activity in the tech industry takes place predominantly in America and
Europe. Why is that?

Few of the answers to that question would be surprising: Africa has a significantly smaller economy; its
infrastructure is less developed; and education is generally less available.

But the economies of African nations are growing faster on average than those in the rich world. And
infrastructure is improving: more than half a billion Africans are now online. And projects like Alphabet's
[Loon](https://loon.com/) are helping to make Internet access even more ubiquitous. And while **education** lags
behind much of the rest of the world, Africa has never had any shortage of **capability** or **innovation**.

And meanwhile, the world is changing. The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic has forced businesses all over the world to
adapt to a new reality of remote work, particularly software engineers — and it's been shown to work! And this
change has taken place while the industry has been one of the least affected by the pandemic.

So a developer's physical location is becoming less and less important: a developer in Lagos with the same
skills as a developer in London can do the same work, particularly as much of Africa lies in timezones close to
Europe's.

Wages, like living costs, across Africa are typically much lower than those in Europe and America. So if a
functional programmer in Africa can perform the same work as a European functional programmer, then why
**shouldn't** they be able to compete for that work on an equal footing?

# Education

Change is difficult, and can take decades. But the most entrenched, lasting changes come about **gradually**
and **steadily**, and are the hardest changes to reverse.

It is our goal to focus on our particular talents, functional programming, and on the people who can benefit
most from them. We want to apply our strongest talents to the places in Africa that are most ready to accept
them and use them.

That may mean that we put more resources into regions that have good infrastructure than regions which don't,
because those are the ones that we can benefit most from what we have to offer, while other organizations
focusing on more basic needs than software development should be encouraged in these places.

Equally, it may mean that we put less resources into Africa's more successful economies, because these have
already reached a critical mass where they can sustain growth.

Our Hiring Consultation will guide our decisions. For all the **passion** we are pouring into this project, we
care about the efficacy of our actions, and are **dispassionate** about our use of data and our guidance by
science and our best economic understanding.

And while we may target resources in particular areas, we exist to support the **whole of Africa**; to bring
about change to an entire continent, and all our online educational resources will be available to
**everyone**.

The economic empowerment of a few functional programmers helps not just those developers, but others around
them. Success in one area breeds success in neighboring areas. And that success will be built on commerce, not
aid; it can be self-sustaining and long-lived.
